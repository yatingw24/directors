        <p>We are in a golden era for women in film. Or so it seems. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie smashed box office records. Coralie Fargeat’s The Substance left Cannes dripping in acclaim. Studios boast about “historic opportunities” for female filmmakers.</p>
        <p>Is it really progress? An unprecedented women’s victory? Or just a history repeating itself? </p>
        <p>When only a few among multiple nominations turned into actual Oscar trophies, the institutional biases against female filmmakers become undeniable. Women aren’t being handed the keys to Hollywood but rather they’re just being allowed into certain rooms.</p>

		<p>More than half of food recalls derived from labeling issues. Undeclared gluten ingredients, such as soy or wheat are found to be the most frequent labeling errors, while 28 percent of food recalls due to a lack of clarity of dairy ingredients such as milk and butter. </p>

        <p>159 out of 408 cases are marked as Class I, accounting for more than one-third of the total food recalls. Among all the severe incidents, labeling issues, such as mislabeled or unclear labels remain the most bothersome. 
        </p>

        <p>Dairy-free, kept refrigerated, perishable, contains nuts - these labels exist for a reason. Without them clearly and visibly appearing on the packaging, one can accidentally consume allergens or intolerances he is physically sensitive about. </p>

        <p>The burden of foodborne illness usually is overlooked because we do not associate it with symptoms that we are too familiar with: vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, and fever. Each year, one in six Americans is estimated to get sick of foodborne illness.</p>

        <p>As labeling issues persist, with a significant number of undeclared allergens driving serious food recalls, grocery retailers disseminate warnings in stores and federal departments post press releases on food safety concerns. However, with public access to food recall datasets shrinking since the second Trump administration, tracking these recalls can be increasingly difficult. To mitigate risks and avoid aggravated symptoms post-consumption, up-to-date data is a must to further prevent people from being alerted. A delay in disseminating crucial information about food safety, if without transparency, may result in symptoms running quickly from mild to severe and from affecting a few to a thousands. </p>
